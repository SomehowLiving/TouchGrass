## Hurdle & Solution

One of the biggest hurdles I faced was trying to use **Sequence alone** to interact with my smart contract and mint the Clique NFT.  
The contract call wasnâ€™t going through as expected, and since the entire project depends on this minting flow, it became a huge blocker.

After some trial and error, I figured out that combining **Sequence with Wagmi** solved the problem. With this setup, I was finally able to mint the NFT successfully.

I didnâ€™t have enough time to polish the UI to the level I wanted, and the chat feature had to be postponed. But Iâ€™m happy that the **core minting flow works** as expected. ðŸŽ‰
